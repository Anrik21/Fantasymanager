# Fantasymanager - A TTRPG program

Hello!

This project is going to be a program that lets you create fantasy calendars and then lets you populate those calendars with events.

V 1.0 is planned to have
A generator that lets you create a custom calendar & historical dates
All the dates - Set the dates you want, anything from 1 day a month and 300 months a year

A GUI that takes your calendar & shows it independently on how your calendar is setup
Add/Remove/Change events - Events contain info and lets you plan around your players
